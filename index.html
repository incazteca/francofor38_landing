        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Franco and I ran for alderman of the 38th Ward in the 2023 Chicago Elections.
          I'd like to thank you for your support during my campaign. At the moment I have no plans on running for office again but I hope that in the future we'll be able to work together to address the issues that Chicago faces.
          You can help move Chicago forward by volunteering with <a href="https://abundantchicago.org">Abundant Chicago</a>
          The following below was my platform for the 2023 election.
        </p>
        <h2>Public Safety</h2>

        <p>
        Work with CPD to increase patrols in our ward by:

        Expand The Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement (CARE) program leaving mental health issues to mental health professionals from the CFD and Chicago Department of Health. This will free up CPD resources to better patrol and address violent crimes.
        Improve CPD morale and mental health by providing mental health resources and enforcing a 4 on, 3 off schedule that will guarantee more days off for officers.
        Build community trust by

        Working with CPD to close cases at a higher rate
        Hold officers accountable for actions that harm the community.
        Oversee that the CPD meets the consent decree put in place by the DOJ.
        Address root causes of crime

        Provide funding for afterschool programs to keep youth off the streets
        Address homelessness by passing “Bring Chicago Home” which will add a one time tax on property sales over $1 million to pay for social services to help the homeless achieve stability
        Provide funding for mental health services
        Work closely with the elected Police District Council members, community organizations, and the community to identify other issues that need addressing.
